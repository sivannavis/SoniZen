# SoniZen
A multi-modal meditative music generation patch in MAX/MSP and Ableton Live. 

Listen to the sound of your body and make music by BEING.

## Notion
When we do meditations, we often close our eyes, stop our movements and focus on our breath, and any changes in our body. Often, they are too subtle to detect, especially for people in a busy world. 

What if we re-activate our body through sound, close our senses and let our ears do the jobï¼Ÿ
